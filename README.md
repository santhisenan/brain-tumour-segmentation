Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation

# TODO


# Experimental analysis
Models => UNet, UNet++, FCN
Encoders => different resnet, attention based encoders
Data augmentation techniques => Read about different technqiues
Post processing => try with and without CRFs


# Notes
- Accuracy improved for baseline without transforms
